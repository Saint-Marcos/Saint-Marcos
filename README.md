- 👋 Hi, I’m @Saint-Marcos
- 👀 I’m interested in challenging programing, architecture and arts. A little ecletic, but that's how humanity works, I guess...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be better. Nothing more, nothing less.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on society relevant projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: marcos.dearch@gmail.com
